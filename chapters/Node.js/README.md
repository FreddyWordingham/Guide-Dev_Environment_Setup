# Node.js - JavaScript runtime

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript.

## Installation

You can install `node` using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

## Usage

You can create a new project using the `npm` command:

```bash
npm init
```

This will create a new `package.json` file in the current directory, which contains information about the project, including the project name, version, and dependencies.

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install some_dependency
```

This will install the specified dependency and add it to the `package.json` file.

You can run a script with:

```bash
npm run my_script
```
