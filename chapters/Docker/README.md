# Docker - Containerization

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers.
Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that contain all the necessary software, libraries, and configurations needed to run a script or application.

## Installation

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

## Usage
