# VSCode - Text Editor

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a text editor.
It is lightweight, fast, and has a large number of extensions available to tailor it to your particular needs and preferences.

## Installation

You can install VSCode using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

When you first open VSCode press `Shift + Command + P` to open the command palette and search for `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.
Execute this command to add the `code` command to your `PATH` so that you can open files in VSCode from the command line like:

```shell
code README.md
```

## Extensions

VSCode supports a wide range of extensions that can be used to customize and extend the editor's functionality, including support for new programming languages, debugging tools, and other features.
You can install extensions from within VSCode by clicking on the `Extensions` icon in the left sidebar.
